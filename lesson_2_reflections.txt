What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- Git creates a hidden folder where it tracks all the changes to files in the
  repository.
  This is needed to tell Git that the folder is a repository and to start
  keeping track of files. I think.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
- Its like an in-between place where you can change your mind before finally
  commiting to a commit. hehe.
