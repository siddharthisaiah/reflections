1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-  When you need to share code with others, working in a team
   if you dont always have access to the same machine
   backup



2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- maybe you dont want the most recent changes. maybe you want to try out adding
  some new/different features.
