1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-  When you need to share code with others, working in a team
   if you dont always have access to the same machine
   backup



2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- maybe you dont want the most recent changes. maybe you want to try out adding
  some new/different features.



3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?
- A fork is cloning someone elses repository.
  cloning is making a copy of a repository.
  branches are like brnches of a tree, essentially the same repository, just a
  little different code or versions of code.
